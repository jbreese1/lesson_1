#1 Create a local variable and modify it at an inner scope. You can try
#a) re-assigning the variable to something else
#b) call a method that doesnâ€™t mutate the caller
#c) call a method that mutates the caller.

#2 Create a local variable at an inner scope and try to 
#  reference it in the outer scope. What happens when you have nested do/end blocks?
